# tic-tac-toe
Classic beloved game to play on the browser!
The idea of this project was in making the logic (rules of game, gameboard, and game status) as a state-machine. As a frontEnd project it was made with pure vanilla JS to practice DOM manipulation without the need of frameworks of any kind.

To try the game fork this repo, open editor and drag the HTML file to your browser. Have fun!üëç
