# tic-tac-toe
Classic beloved game to play on the browser!
The idea of this project was in making the logic (rules of game, gameboard, and game status) as a state-machine. As a frontEnd project it was made with pure vanilla JS to practice DOM manipulation without the need of frameworks of any kind.

To try the game: Fork this repo, open editor and drag the HTML file to your browser or run `google-chrome index.html`. Have fun!üëç
